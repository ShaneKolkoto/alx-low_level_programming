## About

- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [Shane Morne Kolkoto](https://github.com/ShaneKolkoto).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.
